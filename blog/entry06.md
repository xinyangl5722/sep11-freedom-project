### Presentations
After finally finishing my project, I had to present my product twice. One was an in-class presentation which I think it took about eight minutes. Another one was in the exposition which was suppose to last at most two minutes.

I first did my in-class presentation [with these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/151n2cVJjoelnAXX3gmgWlhnhJyF94gT2u6pFBTrlZ4s/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) I did some small drawings for my slides since I want to stand out. However, I saw that some people make their slides have funny gifs to make it more memorable and make the whole class laugh. I'm not comparing myself to others' slides, but I do want to take away from looking at others' slides. I found myself more engaged to the presentation when the slides have more funny gifs. For the actual presenting, I noticed myself that I looked at the board, pointing at things a lot. Although my voice sounds confident to me so far, I believe I did not make enough eye contact with the audience and just either looked more at the board or the computer. So these are my takeaways.
* Use aspects that will make people laugh at my slides may make it more memorable. For example, putting funny gifs will make the presentation funnier and more memorable. This was a takeaway for the slides itself.
* Do not point at the board so often and when you do, make sure you point looking at the board first and then back at the audience more. And when you're not pointing at the board, pick a few people sitting with either to make them as a group and just look at them for a bit, and then look at another group of people. This helps with eye contact without feeling overwhelmed.

I later did my cafeteria exposition presentation a little bit later and I used [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NND8VvwzG52nkiYUVYHXAhSP5LBFjMPxU4UgHNTxeAo/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) as my notes and for presenting at the same time while also presenting [my game](https://xinyangl5722.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/). There was a problem for me while presenting my game. When I was with the regular people that came to watch the presentation, I was able to allow them to interact with my game and actually explain the game with detail, but when I was with the judges, I didn't really gave them much in-depth explanation of my project and rushed through the whole project without giving them the time to actually experiment with my project. This was due to lttle planning for my presentation. So this was my takeaway.
* If planning beforehand, make sure to include what you actually want to present to make it memorable. If I have at most two minutes to actually present, I may need to fill all of the two minutes and make those count. I need to find the key parts for what I want to present and put those in order. After that, I need to spare some moments to allow them to experiment with my game.

### EDP
I can finally say that I have finished with **communicating my results**. I have officially presented my eight minute long in-class presentation and my two minute exposition presentation. I have been through a few experiences while presenting in both presentations such as planning and eye contact. I believe I am finished with my whole progress and now I'm looking forward to see other projects I have not seen yet to get future inspirations.

### Skills
One skill I have developed was **Consideration**. To elaborate, I know my game was supposed to be created for the intent of being used by the intended audience and any other people to use. During the exposition in the cafeteria, I allowed everyone that came up to my game to experiment and have fun with it.
Another skill I have developed was **Communication**. Not only did I just learned my presentations, but I also allowed others to give questions as well. I was able to present my websites and give clear detail of my website.

### Summary
In conclusion, I am looking forward to looking at other projects during the upcoming SEP showcase where I can focus on the 12th grade projects and see what I can take from it. I am also looking forward to what 12th grade will lead me to.
