# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **Pixel Game (still planning)**

---

### 10/13/2024:
* I decided to dig deep into Kaboom since I didn't do that well of a research
	* I looked into the official website first
	* I first went into the playground and looked at some examples. I went into some sort of code where a sprite can move
	* I looked through examples. (I couldn't really find a way to tinker on jsbin because I need an image and I don't have one.)

### 10/18/2024:
* I first created a whole directory dedicate to tinkering my tool
* I decidded to learn how to get kaboom into my IDE
	* I went to the tutorial section of the official website
	* I first learned how to get the CDN into my IDE
	* I copied the CDN into my html
	* Now it's a grey and white checkered background

### 10/19/2024:
* I learned how to put a sprite inside my testing code.
	* I first grabbed a random transparent png photo and then put it in the directory
	* Then I added my sprite into my code
 ```js
const player = add([
	sprite("ghost"),   // sprite() component makes it render as a sprite
 	pos(120, 80),     // pos() component gives it position, also enables movement
])
```
* But when I looked at my sprite, it was too big

### 10/21/2024
* I learned how to move my sprites. i decided to use a different sprite which was the default green bean
	* I went to the playground first because the component tutorials are confusing
	* I saw the code on how they moved it so I put the codes for both arrows into my code so it kind of looks a lot like this.
```js
onKeyDown("left", () => {
	player.move(-SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("right", () => {
	player.move(SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("up", () => {
	player.move(0, -SPEED)
})
onKeyDown("down", () => {
	player.move(0, SPEED)
})
```
* So basically, if the left and right arrows are pressed, speed is at x axis. Negative is left and positive is right.
* If up and down arrows are pressed, speed is at y-axis. Negative is up and positive is down.


### 11/4/2024
* I basically learned how to do a dialogue
* I looked at the playground to see how they did it
* I made a box and made the code for the box.
* Then I created the dialogue which looks something like this-v
```js
const dialogs = [
        [ "bean", "Are you new here?" ],
        [ "bean", "I'm Qing Yao, but you can just call me YaoYao" ],
        [ "bean", "Oh yeah, we are in this Dream land. We are basically trapped in here and we have no choice but to go all through these levels or we will go to insanity."],
        [ "bean", "I need to pass the first three."],
        [ "bean", "Could you help me?"],
        ];
```
* I then started to recreate the code to make the text appear and changes when I press space-v
```js
onKeyPress("space", () => {
            // Cycle through the dialogs
            curDialog = (curDialog + 1) % dialogs.length
            updateDialog()
        })

        function updateDialog() {
            const [ char, dialog ] = dialogs[curDialog]
            // Use a new sprite component to replace the old one
            avatar.use(sprite(char))
            // Update the dialog text
            txt.text = dialog
        }

        updateDialog()
```
* Then I got my dialogue.

### 11/23/2024
* I learned how to make the sprite rotate
* I first looked in playground. Again.
* I went over to see the code that is responsible for making the sprite rotate
	* So I did that with my code
```js
player.onUpdate(() => {
	player.angle += 120 * dt()
})
```
* Then I was like "what if I just take the `dt()`?
* So I took that part out, and then the sprite was spinning really fast
* So then I looked at the 120, and see what happens if I turned it to 10
	* So this was how the code turned out
```js
player.onUpdate(() => {
	player.angle += 10
})
```
* The sprite went a lot slower so the number is saying how fast the sprite is rotating


### 12/8/2024
* Today I first decided to merge the content I had learned.
	* This pretty much means I'm putting the two concepts I learned together.
* So I had frist make the sprite rotate connect with the movement code so it kind of looks like this.
```js
player.onUpdate(() => {
	player.angle += 19 })

onKeyDown("left", () => {
       player.move(-SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("right", () => {
       player.move(SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("up", () => {
       player.move(0, -SPEED)
})
onKeyDown("down", () => {
       player.move(0, SPEED)
})
```
* So now my sprite is turning while moving

### 1/1/2025
* So today, I decided to change the background because I don't want the grey checkered background anymore
* I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cwmwW40jw) on how to make a shooting game so maybe I can use that as inspiration for changing the background
* So I found out that he made his screen pitch black so that could be the first step to my game because I still need to find out how to make sprites and stuff
* So I did the code to change the background to pitch black, and it looks like this
```
kaboom({
	background: [0, 0, 0],
	scale: 0.5,
        });
```
* Kaboom uses RGB color hex, so I used 0,0,0 for it and made a scale for it, but then my sprite was gone.
* So then I decided to delete the scale and see what would happen
```
kaboom({
	background: [0, 0, 0],
        });
```
* And when I run the code again, the sprites finally popped up!


### 1/12/2025
* So I started to figure out how to make my sprite collect an item
* I first grabbed my bean sprite and make the movement code I did
* Then I made the "enemy" that my sprite is going to collect
	* I first made a for loop to add the "enemy" sprite
 	* Then I add the "enemy" spite
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i <1; i++) {
    add([
    	sprite("boy"),
    	scale(0.1),
   	 pos(300,300),
    	// Both objects must have area() component to enable collision detection between
    	area(),
    "	enemy",
    ])
    }
    ```
    * Then I make the sprite collect the "enemy" sprite by using this code
      ```js
      player.onCollide("enemy", (enemy) => {
      	destroy(enemy)
      })
      ```
* Now my sprite can collect the object!

### 3/2/2025
* I learned how to make some sort of obstacle course
	* First I made some sort of layout
	```js
 	const level = addLevel([
            "  @    ",
            "=======",
        ],
 	```
 	* After I made this code, I assigned each symbol for each sprite. Here's what I did
    	```js
     	"=": () => [
                    sprite("boy"),
                    area(),
                    scale(0.1),
                    body({ isStatic: true }),
                    anchor("bot"),
                ],
     	```
     * I did not have a block sprite so I just used a pixel boy for a a block
     * I had learned that the `isStatic: true` code means that the sprite will be the sprite you cannot go over. If you go on top, you will stay on top of that sprite.
     * Then I later make the code for my player sprite which is my green bean (aka my test subject) to move to the left and right (the code is the same code from **10/21** for left and right arrows.
     * To make my sprite jump, I made a code for when the player is standing, then it will jump when pressed the space button.
       ```js
       onKeyPress("space", () => {
            if (player.isGrounded()) {
                player.jump()
            }
        })
       ```
       * So I have learned that the `player.jump` means to jump and `player.isGrounded` means that when the player is on the ground
  * So when I put them all together I have my green bean sprite moving and jumping around the boy sprite
