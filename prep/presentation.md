# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Who creates characters? Who creates stories and their own universes? (THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING THE AUDIENCE AND I KNOW THAT LIKE 10% OF THEM WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND) (Interactive hook) I turn my characters and their setting into life digitally.
* I have 10 universes and I used one of them for this project

## Product
* Include link for game
* Explain what my game is= Pixel story game that includes a chapter
* Explain my story game in like 3 sentences when going through the dialogue.
  * It starts off with the player getting into a dark room and a girl being excited to meet them. Basically the player is passed and has to go through this journey to go to heaven. She talks about how the player is in a place in a journey to Dreamland, but they have to go through obstacles first.

## Process
* Learning the code itself= Basics which is how to add & move characters, making them jump
* I later started to learn how to create scenes in a game and starting to connect them together
  * Use arrays for dialogue and levels
* mvp= No dialogue text -> pushing a key -> Level with a character in a platform
* Beyond mvp= Adding dialogue + Advancing the platform with an actual obstacle course + additional dialogue at the end
  * Challenge= What to do when a player falls off the obstacle course. It just stayed there. I want to reset. So I looked back at Kaboom tutorials to figure it out

## Conclusion
* Takeaway= always plan each scene before learning a tool. What components and code do they need to function? What does each scene need? That way, you won't forget to learn these before you do the project.
* Takeaway 2= Creativity is also important for a game that includes story-telling
* Sometimes, making a game doesn't just focus on code and technology, but the creativity of your mind
* Short permanent link to the game

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
